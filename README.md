The Assignment is to practice writing server-side validations and do server-side processing only using the Express web application framework. 
Tasks:
1.	HTML Static Content - Web Form served using Express.
•	The front end must collect all the information needed to make a sale to the customer. I have included a few in the description which are mandatory and must be included in your form. 
•	At least 2 products should be available for purchase. The application’s business logic must handle the products correctly. 
2.	JavaScript – Server-side form validations and server-side form processing: 
•	All JavaScript code must be located on the server-side.
•	The following user inputs must be validated: 
• Mandatory fields:
	Name 
	Address 
	City 
	Province 
• Fields with specific format
	Phone number validation. eg: 5198201234
	Email validation. eg: test@test.com
•	If any errors exist, display a unique message for each erroneous input. 
•	Generate a receipt to give to the customer, including all the information entered by the user and the products bought. Use only server-side scripting for this. 
•	Calculate and include sales tax for each province/territory in Canada.
